## Why
Every time when install a new server, it really take some time to install these or those tools, i want to make this shit a auto way, and Ansible is born for that.

## Prepare
What you should need to do for the server is just to install it, for me, ubuntu 18.04, and just make sure ssh works, and then you can leave that server alone.

## install ansible
pip install ansible

##
touch /etc/ansible/hosts
